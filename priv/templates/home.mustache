  <h1>Midsummer Night's Tea Party 2:<br>This time it's August</h1>
  <p>
    We're doing a second last-minute Midsummer this year! Come have a delightful
    time in the woods with us!
  </p>

  <h2>When is it?</h2>
  <p>3pm Thursday the 18th August to 10am Monday the 22nd of August.</p>

  <h2>Where is it?</h2>
  <p>The same site as usual, 20 minutes drive from King's Lynn in Norfolk.</p>

  <h2>How many people will there be?</h2>
  <p>We're aiming for around 50 people.</p>

  <h2>Will meals be included?</h2>
  <p>
    Due to this being last minute and the budget being very tight we are unable
    to do food for this event.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we do get enough contributions to cover the Â£3,450 site fee and have
    enough left over we look into bringing the breakfast bar, BBQs, and the
    drinks bar, as these can be organised quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>What facilities are there on site?</h2>
  <p>
    There are flushing toilets, running water, hot showers, and a dreamy outdoor
    bath. There is not mains electricity or cooking facilities so bring your
    camping kit.
  </p>

  <h2>Where will people be sleeping?</h2>
  <p>
    Most people will be camping (so bring your tent), but there are a limited
    number of sleeping structures. These structures will be allocated with
    priority going to people with accessibility requirements.
  </p>

  <h2>Can I refund or sell my ticket?</h2>
  <p>
    Tickets can not be sold for safety reasons. We need to know who everyone is
    on site, any unexpected guests will be asked to leave.
    If we get enough contributions to cover our costs then we be able to offer
    refunds.
  </p>
