  <h1>Midsummer Night's Tea Party 2022</h1>
  <p>Hello friend! It's good to see you!</p>

  <h2>When is it?</h2>
  <p>3pm Thursday the 2nd June to 10am Thursday the 6th of June.</p>

  <h2>Where is it?</h2>
  <p>The same site as usual, 20 minutes drive from King's Lynn in Norfolk.</p>

  <h2>How many people will there be?</h2>
  <p>At most 100 people will be attending.</p>

  <h2>Will meals be included?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, that's the plan!
  </p>
  <p>
    With COVID and Nest running at the same time we are unsure how many people
    will be attending. If we don't raise enough money to cover the cost of the
    site and also food we may need to cancel one or both. In this event we will
    get in touch to arrange refunds.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Can I come?
  </h2>

      pal</a> have attended previously.
