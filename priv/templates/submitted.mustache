    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Account no:</td>
      <td class="monospace">{{account_number}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sort code:</td>
      <td class="monospace">{{sort_code}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Reference:</td>
      <td class="monospace">{{reference}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Amount:</td>
      <td class="monospace">Â£{{amount}}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

    After your payment have been received and and after your place has been

    You've said you've got a rollover ticket, so there's nothing for you to do
    now. We'll email you later when your place has been confirmed.
